                Abstract</u>: In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the analysis of onchain data has emerged as a critical tool for understanding and optimizing digital ecosystems. This talk will provide an overview of onchain data analytics, highlighting its significance in driving transparency, security, and efficiency within decentralized networks.  The talk will explore how onchain data analytics sheds insight into the decentralization of token distribution from an asset perspective. By examining case studies, we will delve into practical applications where onchain analytics has played a pivotal role in early fraud detection, identifying malicious activities before they can compromise the integrity of the network. Additionally, we will discuss how intention analysis, powered by onchain data, can provide valuable insights into user behavior, aiding in the development of more secure and user-centric blockchain applications.

                Abstract</u>: The advance of digital technology brings significant benefits to humanity. However, there is a growing demand for greater transparency and visibility of risks before integrating more digital technologies into daily life and delegating critical functions to AI-driven services. Convincing existing tech companies, teams, or individuals to prioritise security and regulation is unrealistic without clear benefits. One solution is to create a well-regulated but decentralised system that runs parallel to what we might consider the "free-style" digital world. It offers a new direction and ecosystem that encourages and motivates the development of regulations, transparency, and the prevention of potential risks from rogue AI or systems.
