                Abstract</u>: In the rapidly evolving landscape of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), the analysis of onchain data has emerged as a critical tool for understanding and optimizing digital ecosystems. This talk will provide an overview of onchain data analytics, highlighting its significance in driving transparency, security, and efficiency within decentralized networks.  The talk will explore how onchain data analytics sheds insight into the decentralization of token distribution from an asset perspective. By examining case studies, we will delve into practical applications where onchain analytics has played a pivotal role in early fraud detection, identifying malicious activities before they can compromise the integrity of the network. Additionally, we will discuss how intention analysis, powered by onchain data, can provide valuable insights into user behavior, aiding in the development of more secure and user-centric blockchain applications.

                Abstract</u>: The advance of digital technology brings significant benefits to humanity. However, there is a growing demand for greater transparency and visibility of risks before integrating more digital technologies into daily life and delegating critical functions to AI-driven services. Convincing existing tech companies, teams, or individuals to prioritise security and regulation is unrealistic without clear benefits. One solution is to create a well-regulated but decentralised system that runs parallel to what we might consider the "free-style" digital world. It offers a new direction and ecosystem that encourages and motivates the development of regulations, transparency, and the prevention of potential risks from rogue AI or systems.

                Abstract</u>: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) represents
an innovative approach to managing physical infrastructure using blockchain technology. By 2024, the market capitalization of
DePIN-related projects has surpassed $10 billion, reflecting significant popularity and investment. Despite the excitement within
the Web3 community, there is a notable lack of academic research
on DePIN’s foundational aspects and economic impact. This paper
addresses these gaps with a comprehensive analysis of the DePIN
ecosystem. We categorize various DePIN networks by economic
sectors, examine the unique characteristics of DePIN data assets,
and investigate the economic mechanisms of DePIN implementations. Through a detailed taxonomy, real-world data analysis, and
assessment of economic incentives, this study aims to enhance the
understanding of DePIN and to support its development as a sustainable and efficient model for managing physical infrastructure.

                Abstract</u>: The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a layer 2 protocol designed to facilitate fast and inexpensive Bitcoin transactions. It operates by establishing channels between users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain until the channels are closed, with
only the initial and final transactions recorded on the blockchain.
Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is crucial for
users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to collect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the
network, forming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we
analyze the graph structure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical relationships between node properties using
machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We
formulate a series of tasks to explore these relationships and provide
benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how topological
and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation
of several models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks
and highlights the insights gained from their application.

            <div class="collapsible-content" style="display: none;">
                Abstract</u>: The need for data security and model integrity has been accentuated by the rapid adoption of AI and ML in data-driven domains
including healthcare, finance, and security. Large models are crucial
for tasks like diagnosing diseases and forecasting finances but tend
to be delicate and not very scalable. Decentralized systems solve
this issue by distributing the workload and reducing central points
of failure. Yet, data and processes spread across different nodes can
be at risk of unauthorized access, especially when they involve
sensitive information. Nesa solves these challenges with a comprehensive framework using multiple techniques to protect data
and model outputs. This includes zero-knowledge proofs for secure
model verification. The framework also introduces consensus-based
verification checks for consistent outputs across nodes and confirms model integrity. Split Learning divides models into segments
processed by different nodes for data privacy by preventing full
data access at any single point. For hardware-based security, trusted
execution environments are used to protect data and computations
within secure zones. Nesa’s state-of-the-art proofs and principles
demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, making it a promising
approach for securely democratizing artificial intelligence.

            <div class="collapsible-content" style="display: none;">
                Abstract</u>: Ensuring privacy and security while reaching consensus presents major issues in evolving decentralized systems. Traditional consensusbuilding techniques without encryption frequently compromise privacy and confidentiality by requiring participants to reveal sensitive information. Meanwhile, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Web3, these traditional consensuses, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) can not fit the
characteristics of AI tasks anymore. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus in AI tasks. This framework guarantees data privacy with the calculations on
encrypted data during the consensus procedure. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of malicious clients stealing or free-riding on others’ value within the decentralized system. By proving the security
properties of correctness and ciphertext indistinguishability with FHE, our approach offers a robust solution for achieving consensus while safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of participants’ data. To validate our framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness
through empirical security analysis and performance analysis.
