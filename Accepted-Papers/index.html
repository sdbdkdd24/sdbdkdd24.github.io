                <u>Abstract</u>: Ensuring privacy and security while reaching consensus presents major issues in evolving decentralized systems. Traditional consensusbuilding techniques without encryption frequently compromise privacy and confidentiality by requiring participants to reveal sensitive information. Meanwhile, with the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into Web3, these traditional consensuses, such as Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) can not fit the
characteristics of AI tasks anymore. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach leveraging Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to encrypt Proof of Intelligence (PoI) consensus in AI tasks. This framework guarantees data privacy with the calculations on
encrypted data during the consensus procedure. Additionally, it mitigates the risk of malicious clients stealing or free-riding on others’ value within the decentralized system. By proving the security
properties of correctness and ciphertext indistinguishability with FHE, our approach offers a robust solution for achieving consensus while safeguarding the integrity and confidentiality of participants’ data. To validate our framework, we demonstrate its effectiveness
through empirical security analysis and performance analysis.

                <u>Abstract</u>: The Bitcoin Lightning Network is a layer 2 protocol designed to facilitate fast and inexpensive Bitcoin transactions. It operates by establishing channels between users, where Bitcoin is locked and transactions are conducted off-chain until the channels are closed, with
only the initial and final transactions recorded on the blockchain.
Routing transactions through intermediary nodes is crucial for
users without direct channels, allowing these routing nodes to collect fees for their services. Nodes announce their channels to the
network, forming a graph with channels as edges. In this paper, we
analyze the graph structure of the Lightning Network and investigate the statistical relationships between node properties using
machine learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We
formulate a series of tasks to explore these relationships and provide
benchmarks for GNN architectures, demonstrating how topological
and neighbor information enhances performance. Our evaluation
of several models reveals the effectiveness of GNNs in these tasks
and highlights the insights gained from their application.

                <u>Abstract</u>: The emergence of Web3 has provided new opportunities but still
lacks technology support for research and innovation. We propose
Web3Env, the first open-source online platform for Web3 scientific
research and applications. The design of Web3Env is intended for
interdisciplinary collaborations and human-centered computation.
Firstly, Web3 provides a reinforcement learning environment that
can be customized for scientific research in various application scenarios in Web3. Secondly, Web3Env offers open APIs that support
interaction with reinforcement learning data and algorithms, connecting the Web3-oriented environments to specific computational
tasks. Last but not least, Web3Env supports non-coding programming by providing a user interface (UI), facilitating collaborations
of professionals and experts from a broad range of disciplines. We
present the design, demo, and two applications of our platform for
Web3.

                <u>Abstract</u>: Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network (DePIN) represents
an innovative approach to managing physical infrastructure using blockchain technology. By 2024, the market capitalization of
DePIN-related projects has surpassed $10 billion, reflecting significant popularity and investment. Despite the excitement within
the Web3 community, there is a notable lack of academic research
on DePIN’s foundational aspects and economic impact. This paper
addresses these gaps with a comprehensive analysis of the DePIN
ecosystem. We categorize various DePIN networks by economic
sectors, examine the unique characteristics of DePIN data assets,
and investigate the economic mechanisms of DePIN implementations. Through a detailed taxonomy, real-world data analysis, and
assessment of economic incentives, this study aims to enhance the
understanding of DePIN and to support its development as a sustainable and efficient model for managing physical infrastructure.

                <u>Abstract</u>: Blockchain technology is critical to the future of the digital economy and the metaverse, serving as a foundation for everything
from decentralized finance to virtual assets. Yet, its full potential
is constrained by the "Blockchain Trilemma," which necessitates
a balance among decentralization, security, and scalability. This
study compares Algorand and Ethereum 2.0, two leading blockchain
platforms, to evaluate how they measure up against these critical
metrics. Our research analyzes decentralization indices, scalability metrics, and security protocols within both ecosystems. The
findings aim to shed light on each platform’s strategies and their
efficacy in overcoming the trilemma challenges, thus advancing the
dialogue on blockchain development for robust digital infrastructures.

                <u>Abstract</u>: The rapid growth of large-scale AI models, particularly large language models has brought significant challenges in data privacy,
computational resources, and accessibility. Traditional centralized
architectures often struggle to meet required data security and
scalability needs which hinders the democratization of AI systems.
Nesa introduces a model-agnostic sharding framework designed for
decentralized AI inference. Our framework uses blockchain-based
sequential deep neural network sharding to distribute computational tasks across a diverse network of nodes based on a personalised heuristic and routing mechanism. This enables efficient distributed training and inference for recent large-scale models even
on consumer-grade hardware. We use compression techniques like
dynamic blockwise quantization and mixed matrix decomposition
to reduce data transfer and memory needs. We also integrate robust
security measures, including hardware-based trusted execution environments to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Evaluating
our system across various natural language processing and vision
tasks shows that these compression strategies do not compromise
model accuracy. Our results highlight the potential to democratize access to cutting-edge AI technologies by enabling secure and
efficient inference on a decentralized network.

                <u>Abstract</u>: The need for data security and model integrity has been accentuated by the rapid adoption of AI and ML in data-driven domains
including healthcare, finance, and security. Large models are crucial
for tasks like diagnosing diseases and forecasting finances but tend
to be delicate and not very scalable. Decentralized systems solve
this issue by distributing the workload and reducing central points
of failure. Yet, data and processes spread across different nodes can
be at risk of unauthorized access, especially when they involve
sensitive information. Nesa solves these challenges with a comprehensive framework using multiple techniques to protect data
and model outputs. This includes zero-knowledge proofs for secure
model verification. The framework also introduces consensus-based
verification checks for consistent outputs across nodes and confirms model integrity. Split Learning divides models into segments
processed by different nodes for data privacy by preventing full
data access at any single point. For hardware-based security, trusted
execution environments are used to protect data and computations
within secure zones. Nesa’s state-of-the-art proofs and principles
demonstrate the framework’s effectiveness, making it a promising
approach for securely democratizing artificial intelligence.
